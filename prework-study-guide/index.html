          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage for the browser.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
            <li>The body element is the parent element, everything inside it are its child elements.</li>
            <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
            <li>"id" attribute identifies elements to select them</li>
            <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage</li>
            <li>The name of semantic HTML elements describe its content and the role it plays on the page. </li>
            <li> span tag creates an inline division.</li>
            <li>h1 > h6</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content INSIDE an element.</li>
          <li>Increasing padding makes the entire element bigger!</li>
          <li>Declarations have 2 main parts: CSS property and the value of that property.</li>
          <li>Select a class with a dot .class</li>
          <li>3 ways to implement: Inline, Internal Style Sheet, External Style Sheet</li>
          <li>Inline is good for quick and permanent changes.</li>
          <li>Internal is embedded with style tag in HTML head (only applies to that page).</li>
          <li>External file is linked in HTML head.</li>
          <li>Displaying an image as a block will center it.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JS is read top to bottom.</li>
          <li>JS is linked in body element of HTML.</li>
          <li>If statements tell the program to leave normal flow if certain conditions are met.</li>
          <li>Checks to see if condition evaluates to true or false, which determines the next action.</li>
          <li>Strict equality === sees if 2 values are equal, and returns a boolean true/false.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that holds a group of related data.</li>
          <li>Arrays are used to perform tasks on several pieces of data at once.</li>
          <li>Use the index number of a data piece to call it in an array (starts at 0).</li>
          <li>For loops execute code of block over and over.</li>
          <li>For loops have 3 components: initalization (declare a variable), condition, icrement(++).</li>
          <li>The loop will run as long as the condition is true.</li>
          <li>(++) Every time the code loops, the variable will increase by 1.</li>
          <li>Functions are used to define and reuse blocks of code.</li>
          <li>After defined, function has to be called to execute. It is not automatic like for loops or conditional statements.</li>
